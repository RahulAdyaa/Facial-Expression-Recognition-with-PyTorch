🎭 Facial Expression Recognition with PyTorch

📌 Overview

This project implements a Facial Expression Recognition system using PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of facial images to classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc. The goal is to develop an efficient deep learning model that can accurately recognize human facial expressions.

🌟 Features

✅ Preprocessing of facial images (grayscale conversion, normalization, resizing)✅ Deep learning model built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)✅ Training and validation pipelines with real-time loss and accuracy monitoring✅ Support for dataset augmentation to improve generalization✅ Model evaluation and inference for real-world applications

📂 Dataset

The model is trained on the FER2013 dataset, which consists of grayscale images (48x48 pixels) categorized into different facial expressions:

😊 Happy

😡 Angry

😢 Sad

😱 Surprised

😐 Neutral

😨 Fear

🤢 Disgust

🚀 Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RahulAdyaa/Facial-Expression-Recognition-with-PyTorch.git
cd Facial-Expression-Recognition-with-PyTorch

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy pasndas torch matplotlib timm

🛠️ Usage

🔥 Training the Model

Run the following command to train the model on the dataset:

python train.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 64 --lr 0.001

📊 Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the trained model on the test dataset:

python evaluate.py --model_path models/best_model.pth

🎭 Running Inference

To test the model on a single image:

python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg --model_path models/best_model.pth

🏗️ Model Architecture

The model uses a CNN-based architecture with the following layers:

🏗️ Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input images

🌀 Batch Normalization & Dropout: Improve generalization and prevent overfitting

🎯 Fully Connected Layers: Perform final classification

📈 Performance

The model achieves an accuracy of ~70% on the FER2013 test set. Performance improvements can be achieved through:

🔧 Hyperparameter tuning

🔄 Transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG16)

🏷️ Collecting additional labeled datasets
